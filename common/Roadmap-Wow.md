## Roadmap & Wow‑Factor Add‑ons

### Phased Delivery
- **v1 (MVP)**: Image upload, sampling/density, core forces (attract/repel/vortex), healing, basic export (WebM), embed snippet (beta), presets (local).
- **v1.1**: Collider + shockwave + wind presets; motion blur/trails; MP4/GIF export; WordPress docs.
- **v1.2**: Background removal (on‑device), palette simplification; public preset gallery.
- **v2.0**: GPU compute path; React Native demo; PWA; cloud export/share links.

### Wow Features
- **Audio‑reactive mode**: beat detection; amplitude → force modulation.
- **Depth simulation**: parallax layers; z‑sorted particles; depth‑based healing.
- **AI‑generated forces**: model proposes parameter curves/fields over time.
- **Multi‑user mode**: realtime shared canvas (WebRTC/WebSockets) with conflict‑free healing.

### Risks
- Encoder compatibility; mobile performance variance; shader portability.

### Measures of Success
- Preset shares/downloads; embeds on external sites; export completion rate; FPS telemetry.
